# Rainbow_Crash_assembly_programming_language
#### Actually, this is pseudo formal assembly programming language that you can directly use C compiler to compile out, it's implemented by macro in C, of course it is compilable (underneath is C).
#### After include RV64i.c, then you can write your C code in assembly style like below:

```c

```
#### AWESOME, COOL right?
